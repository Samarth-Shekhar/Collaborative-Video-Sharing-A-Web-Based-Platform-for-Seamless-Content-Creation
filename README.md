# Collaborative-Video-Sharing-A-Web-Based-Platform-for-Seamless-Content-Creation

Collaborative Video Sharing is a full-stack web platform designed to streamline the workflow between YouTube content creators and their editors. I have built this project using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. It allows creators to securely link their YouTube channels via OAuth2 and generate a unique access key that editors can use to upload videos on their behalfâ€”without needing account credentials. The platform emphasizes security, ease of use, and efficient collaboration.
